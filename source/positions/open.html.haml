  %strong{style: "text-decoration: underline;"} Multiple research positions in the Bhandawat lab 
%h2{style: "font-size: 16px;"} Short Introduction to the Bhandawat Lab
%p We study how animal behavior emerges from the complex interaction amongst the animal's nervous systems, their muscle-body dynamics, and their environment. We use fruitflies (Drosophila melanogaster) as our model organism because they perform many complex behaviors with a relatively simple brain, and because of the many genetic tools that are available in the flies. We employ a multi-pronged approach which includes in vivo whole-cell patch clamp recordings, imaging, quantitative measurement of behavior, biomechanics and computation. 

%h2{style: "font-size: 16px;"} Multiple positions at various levels
%p We are looking to hire multiple researchers at different stages of their career. We have a range of projects differing in complexity and in time required to complete them. 

%p Since our aim is to understand each step of the process from sensation to action, we are looking for 
%ol
  %li Systems neuroscientists with interest in both sensory and motor neuroscience, 
  %li Researchers interested in nuts and bolts of motor control including the interaction of nervous system with the musculo-skeletal system, 
  %li Reseachers interested in biomechanics of legged locomotion, 
  %li Computational neuroscientists.

%p We are looking to build a diverse team of biologist, neuroscientists and engineers.
